Ideas:
* search dataset for features than predict survival by > 50%
* group ages and see if that makes any difference to predicting male/female survival
* group non-ages and see if that makes any difference to predicting male/female survival
* look at how SibSp / Pclass relationship affects survival
* look at how Parch / Pclass relationship affects survival
* investigate genetic programming
